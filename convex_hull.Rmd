## loading gtfs from 7.7.2021 (takes a while)  
The {gtfstools} package allows for loading of an entire gtfs file. 
it takes a while but it is worthwhile because it is more clean.  
in this stage, we perform the analysis on beersheva only  
```{r}
spo_gtfs <- read_gtfs("D:/Downloads/gtfs.zip",encoding = "UTF-8")
```

## beer sheva convex hull polygon  
filter all routes operated by dan beersheva  
join trips, stop times and stops coords  
create a multipoint enttity  
convex hull  

```{r}
bs_pol <- spo_gtfs$routes %>% 
  # at first, only for Dan Beer sheva
  filter(agency_id == 32) %>% 
  select(route_id,route_desc) %>% 
  # join with trips
  left_join(spo_gtfs$trips, by = "route_id") %>% 
  left_join(spo_gtfs$stop_times, by = "trip_id") %>% 
  distinct(stop_id) %>% 
  left_join(spo_gtfs$stops, by = "stop_id") %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("stop_lon","stop_lat"),crs = 4326) %>% 
  st_transform(2039) %>% 
  summarise() %>% 
  st_convex_hull() 
```



## creating lines that go through beersheva  
first, we filter only shapes that go through bs_pol 
we take all distinct shape_id and join them to trips,routes, and back to shapes  
we create a geometry for each line makat.  
we transform the geometry from wgs84 to ITM.  
 
```{r}
lines <- spo_gtfs$shapes %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords =c("shape_pt_lon" ,"shape_pt_lat"),crs=4326) %>% 
  st_transform(2039) %>% 
  filter(st_intersects(geometry,bs_pol,sparse = F)) %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  distinct(shape_id) %>% 
  # join with trips
  left_join(spo_gtfs$trips, by = "shape_id") %>% 
  left_join(spo_gtfs$routes, by = "route_id") %>% 
  left_join(spo_gtfs$shapes, by = "shape_id") %>% 
  select(route_id,route_desc,shape_id,shape_pt_sequence,shape_pt_lon ,shape_pt_lat) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  # arrange points in each line by sequence 
  arrange(route_desc,shape_id,shape_pt_sequence) %>% 
  # create linestring for each line
  group_by(route_desc,shape_id) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(line = st_sfc(map(data, ~.x %>% 
                      select(shape_pt_lon ,shape_pt_lat) %>%
                      as.matrix() %>% 
                      st_linestring() ),crs=4326),
         # transform to ITM
         line = st_transform(line,2039)) %>% 
  select(-data) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  st_sf() 
m1 <- mapview(lines,zcol = "route_desc")
m1@map
```
## create intersections between lines  
intersections points between the lines are created by:  
1. exploding all of the lines above to segments  
2. subsetting to only distinct segments  
3. parsing all distinct segments to a spatial network, that includes edges and nodes  
the nodes are one source for intersections, however some of them are irrelevant (see stage 5)  
4. adding intersections that are created by intersection of two segments without a connecting node.  
this is somewhat problematic because it assumes we deal with a planar graph, and that means that bridges and tunnels will subdived segments.  
5. smoothing segments - removing nodes that are connected to only 2 edges, making more uniform edges.  
this eliminates nodes that were created in the lines explosion and are irrelevant for the analysis. 
```{r}
intersections <- 
  # explode all lines
  st_segments(lines$line) %>% 
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  # get only distinct segments
  distinct() %>% 
  # parse as sfnetoworks object
  as_sfnetwork() %>% 
  # subdivide segments that intersect (assuming planar graph)
  convert(to_spatial_subdivision) %>% 
  # smooth useless nodes
  convert(to_spatial_smooth) %>% 
  st_as_sf() 
m2 <- mapview(intersections)
m2@map
```

## get relevant stops  
using the routes, trips, stop_times and stops tables, we create a layer where each stop connected to its line makat and to its place in the stops sequence. 
```{r}
stops_routes <- spo_gtfs$routes %>% 
  # at first, only for Dan Beer sheva
  filter(route_desc %in% unique(lines$route_desc)) %>% 
  # join change until getting to stops
  left_join(spo_gtfs$trips, by = "route_id") %>% 
  left_join(spo_gtfs$stop_times, by = "trip_id") %>% 
  left_join(spo_gtfs$stops,by = "stop_id") %>% 
  # get only distinct stops per line
  select(route_id,route_desc,shape_id,stop_id,stop_sequence,stop_lat,stop_lon)  %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("stop_lon","stop_lat"),crs = 4326) %>% 
  st_transform(2039)
m3 <- mapview(stops_routes,zcol = "route_desc")
m3@map
```

## create makats  
get all line makats in order to iterate over the lines and stop_routes  
```{r}
makats <- lines$route_desc
```

## cutting the line  
using [st_network_blend](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/reference/st_network_blend.html) as the main workhorse  

![](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/reference/st_network_blend-1.png)
for each line makat:  
  get line  
  get stops along route  
  transform line to spatial network  
  blend stops along route (first order segments) to spatial network using 10 meter snapping tolarance  
  blend other stops  (first order segments) using 10 meter snapping tolarance   
  blend intersections using 0.1 meter snapping tolerance   
in the map, we see the cuts in orange, the segments in light blue, the intersections in yellow and the stops in blue. you can turn the layers on and off to check the result.   
```{r}
# 10359-2-#
line_with_all_cuts <- map(makats,function(x){
  print(x)
  line <- lines %>% filter(route_desc == x)
  stops <- stops_routes %>% filter(route_desc == x)
  line %>% 
    as_sfnetwork() %>% 
    st_network_blend(stops,10) %>% 
    {
      a = try(st_network_blend((.),stops_routes,10),silent = TRUE )
      if(class(a) == "try-error"){
        res <- (.)
      }else{
        res <- a
      }
      res
    }%>%   
    st_network_blend(intersections,0.1)
})
# vis of example
line_with_all_cuts[[11]] %>% activate(nodes) %>% st_as_sf() -> cuts
line_with_all_cuts[[11]] %>% activate(edges) %>% st_as_sf() -> liness
m4 <- mapview(cuts,col.regions = "orange")
m5 <- mapview(liness)
m6 <- mapview(intersections,col.regions = "yellow")
m7 <- mapview(stops_routes,col.regions = "blue")
m8 <-  m5+m6+m7 + m4

m8@map
```

## limitations  
doesnt cut already used intersections  
only beer sheva area  
needs snapping parameter for type 2 segments  
doesnt account for directions in snapping type 2 segments  
  
## next steps  
creating tables  
discussing joining different GTFSs
